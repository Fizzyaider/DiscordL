# DiscordL
This application will allow for a "faster" (by faster, I mean faster in terms of how things are done. DiscordL is mostly automating the task of translating text into discord) translation bridge between your desktop DeepL, inserting translated text into discord, allowing for typing as if you were fluently typing the language you are translating into and allow for much faster and fluid conversations while using it. It is recommended that you use "obvious" words in your language to indicate to DeepL what language is being used since DiscordL will be reliant on DeepL's auto-detection features until DiscordL has machine learning integrated into it (DeepL API integration will be added on further down the line).

______________________________________________
## This issue has now been fixed by changing the namespace, the project is now fully known by Visual Studio as DiscordL and not DeepS anymore

~~### *Concerning why there are references to DeepS*~~

~~DeepS was the old project name before it was decided that DiscordL would be the project name, due to some complications with trying to rename folders and change where files point to it has been left there for ease. If you feel brave to step up to the task of sorting all of this out though, feel free. The folders and file pointers will be changed at somepoint though so that it references "DiscordL" instead of "DeepS".~~

Saying all of this, you have my apologies if the usage of the name DeepS leaves you with confusion.
