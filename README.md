# DiscordL
This application will allow for a "faster" (by faster, I mean faster in terms of how things are done. DiscordL is mostly automating the task of translating text into discord) translation bridge between your desktop DeepL, inserting translated text into discord, allowing for typing as if you were fluently typing the language you are translating into and allow for much faster and fluid conversations while using it. It is recommended that you use "obvious" words in your language to indicate to DeepL what language is being used since DiscordL will be reliant on DeepL's auto-detection features until DiscordL has machine learning integrated into it (DeepL API integration will be added on further down the line).
